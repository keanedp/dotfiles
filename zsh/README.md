# Zsh

Minimal zsh config

### Reasoning

An attempt to get a quality shell experience without requiring oh-my-zsh.

Full blown oh-my-zsh config can be found at: https://github.com/keanedp/.zsh

### Setup

Install zsh-syntax-highlighting and zsh-completions with your favorite package manager (brew, pacman, etc...)

Create a file named ~/.zshenv

```
echo 'ZDOTDIR=$HOME/dotfiles/zsh' >> ~/.zshenv
```
